Gas pollutant analysis for monitoring sites in North Carolina. The data was 
collected at CASTNET sites, which provide air quality data in rural locations 
(often upwind or downwind of urban areas). On the EPA website, we filtered and 
downloaded the available data for North Carolina from February 1, 2020 to 
February 1, 2025. In total (prior to any further data preparation), there are 
1082 observations in this dataset. It includes the following columns: SITE_ID, 
Week, Year, DATEOFF, Ca, Cl, HNO3, HNO3.PPB, K, Mg, Na, NH4, NO3, SO2, SO2.PPB, 
SO4, TNO3, and DATEON. We added a column for seasons for analysis purposes. For 
the purpose of our analysis, the independent variables will be time (Week and 
Year), season, and location (SITE_ID) and the dependent variables will be 
pollutants (Ca, Cl, HNO3, K, Mg, Na, NH4, NO3, SO2, SO4, and TNO3).
